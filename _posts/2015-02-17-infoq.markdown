_As we discussed in our first [post][part1], [Lasp][lasp] is the name of
our distributed deterministic programming model that is the basis of our
research into providing a more expressive way of working with CRDTs and
eventual consistency._

My work on [Lasp][lasp] was featured on [InfoQ][infoq] today in an article
titled: [Highly Distributed Computations Without Synchronization][article].

In this article, we motivate the design of Lasp, and explore one
possible design of our eventually consistent advertisement counter.

I also enourage you to follow along on [GitHub][lasp] if you're
interested in learning more!
