_As we discussed in our first [post][part1], [Lasp][lasp] is the name of
our distributed deterministic programming model that is the basis of our
research into providing a more expressive way of working with CRDTs and
eventual consistency._

[Peter Van Roy][pvr] will be discussing our work on [Lasp][lasp] at two
seminars this month.  If you're around, you should check them out!

* Lasp: a language for eventually consistent distributed programming
  with CRDTs at [KTH][kth] on March 5th.
* Lasp: a language for eventually consistent distributed programming
  with CRDTs at [IST][ist] on March 13th.
