Mid May, I gave a talk at [NodePDX][nodepdx] on [functional reactive
programming][frp] in JavaScript. I discussed the general ideas behind
the programming paradigm and various implementations that exist.  The
[video][video] is finally available online and the [slides][slides] are
also available.
