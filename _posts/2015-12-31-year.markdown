With 2015 wrapping up and 2016 ahead of us, I find it important to look
back on what happened over the course of the year and set goals for
how I'd like my work to develop over the coming year.

I'm not going to enumerate the events of the past year, because they've
already been discussed in various sections of my blog.  I would like to
take a moment to highlight some of my favorite experiences, along with
those which I consider most valuable to my development as a researcher
and engineer.

When I [did this last year][lastyear], I differentiated between events
in my personal life, academic life, and industry life.  I am not going
to do that this year, as I feel that while I may have done less overall
most of the accomplishments that I'm most proud of this year are focused
around a central theme: my Ph.D. thesis work, declarative edge
computation, functional programming, and a little project I've been
involved in called Lasp.

Here we go.

* I was the recipient of a [fellowship][emjd] in the Erasmus Mundus Joint
  Doctorate program in Distributed Computing and will begin my Ph.D. in
  2016 co-advised by [Peter Van Roy][pvr] and [Rodrigo Rodrigues][rr], with an
  amazing committee featuring [Peter Alvaro][palvaro] and [Seif
  Haridi][sh].
* I was lucky enough to be able to speak about my work on [Lasp][lasp]
  at some major events such as [Erlang Factory 2015][erlang-factory-2015],
  [Strange Loop 2015][strangeloop-2015], [Code Mesh 2015][codemesh-2015],
  [RICON 2015][ricon-2015] and [GOTO Chicago 2015][goto-2015].
* I made a [draft][thesis-proposal] of my thesis proposal available and
  published an article on how [databases may be the wrong abstraction as
  we move towards edge computation][tendency].
* I participated on the [Eurosys 2015][eurosys-2015], [DEBS
  2015][debs-2015] and [Erlang Workshop 2015][erlang-workshop-2015]
  program committees.
* Following from my [Papers We Love talk in 2014][papers-we-love-2014],
  I achieved a Papers We Love "hat trick" with two talks in 2015: one in
  [Paris][papers-we-love-2015-paris] and one in [San
  Francisco][papers-we-love-2015-sf].
* I was featured on the [Functional Geekery][geekery] podcast talking
  about Lasp and functional programming.
* I had my first conference publication with Lasp at [PPDP
  2015][ppdp-2015].
* Lasp also appeared at [PaPoC 2015][papoc-2015], [W-PSDS
  2015][w-psds-2015], [Erlang Workshop 2015][erlang-workshop-2015]
  and will appear at [OBT 2016][obt-2016] and
  [EdgeCom 2016][edgecom-2016] in January.
* I travelled to Paris and Berlin to speak about [Riak][bobkonf2015-riak] and
  [Webmachine][bobkonf2015-webmachine].
* I [left Basho][left-basho] and started working at [Machine Zone][machinezone].
* I moved to San Francisco, CA.

Goals for the next year?  It boils down to two major professional goals:

* Survive a move to Belgium.
* Successfully change from a 15 year career in industry to a student in
  academic in a Ph.D. programme.

Wish me luck!
