After three and a half years at [Basho](http://basho.com),
I've decided to move on.

Leaving a job that you love and have been very successful with over many
years is always a very difficult thing to do.  However, there comes a
point where in order to continue to grow you must make a drastic
change and reinvent yourself.

Starting as a Ruby and JavaScript engineer when first hired at Basho, I had to the opportunity to grow as a [conference speaker](http://christophermeiklejohn.com/videos.html), [travel the world](http://christophermeiklejohn.com/personal/2015/01/01/year.html), [have original research published](http://christophermeiklejohn.com/publications.html), work on an international [research project](https://syncfree.lip6.fr), and become an [accomplished distributed systems](https://github.com/basho/riak) engineer.

I'm truly grateful for my time at Basho.

# Lessons

The biggest thing I'd like to emphasize after all of my time at Basho is
that *you can do whatever you want to*.

When I started at Basho I was hired as a JavaScript engineer.  I didn't
know what a distributed system was, I didn't know what concurrency was,
didn't know what parallelism was, didn't know what mutexes were.  I
learned it all on the job *because I wanted to*.

I was never asked to be in SyncFree.  I found out there was a meetup in
Belgium in January and I bought my own plane ticket and took vacation
time.

I dropped out of undergrad around 4 times.  I dropped out of graduate
school around 3 times.  Brown University told me I would never be a
graduate student given my "lack of undergraduate research."

I hustled as hard as I can, I independently published papers, I worked
my ass off to do what *I believed in.*

You can do this.  I'm not special; I just worked hard and so can you!

I leave you with a quote from Tyler Durden in Fight Club that inspires
me: "You decide your own level of involvement."
