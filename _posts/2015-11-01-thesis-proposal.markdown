I've posted an initial version of my [thesis proposal](/publications/thesis-proposal.pdf) and I'd love any and all feedback.

I've received a lot of questions from other academics regarding my
thesis proposal: Why are you doing it so early?  You haven't even
started your program yet, how can you know what your thesis is going to
be?

In Europe, most Ph.D. students are required to start with a Master's
degree already in hand.  This results in most Ph.D. funding lasting
around three years; most students who need additional funding to finish
their thesis, must try to obtain additional funding, either in
fellowships, grants, or money from European Union sponsored research
projects under either the [FP7](https://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/) or
[Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) projects, if
you are a computer science student.

That said, a thesis proposal is required __upon registration__ to the
university, and then be modified as you proceed in the program, allowing
you to focus in the work as you perform research.

The draft I've posted today represents the initial first pass of my
thesis proposal, sufficient enough for entry into the university.

I welcome your feedback!
