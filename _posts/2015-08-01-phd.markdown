_This post is a continuation of my first post about [leaving Basho Technologies](http://christophermeiklejohn.com/lasp/2015/06/28/moving-on.html) after almost 4 years._

It has been quite a long time in the making, but I'm finally happy to
annouce that I am the recipient of a [Erasmus Mundus](http://emjd-dc.eu)
fellowship in their Joint Doctorate in Distribute Computing program.  I
will be pursuing a full-time Ph.D., with my thesis devoted to developing
the [Lasp programming language](https://lasp-lang.org) for distributed
computing with the goals of simplifying deterministic, distributed, edge
computation.

Starting in February 2016, I will be moving to Belgium to begin my first
year of studies at the [Universit√© catholique de
Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/index.html) supervised by [Peter Van
Roy](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/) followed by a second year in
Lisbon at [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).
